**Description of the problem you solved**
As AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude become integrated into daily workflows, employees frequently paste sensitive information—like API keys, PII, and proprietary code—into prompts, risking data breaches and compliance violations. PromptGuard solves this by providing an intercepting firewall (via a Chrome Extension and a Developer API) that automatically detects, masks, or blocks restricted data locally before it leaves the user's environment. This empowers teams to safely leverage AI tools without compromising their security posture or data privacy.
